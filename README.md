# UI Vulnerablity Page Improvement

## Introduction
In this modification, we are transitioning the data filtering process from the front-end to the backend. The UI now has the capability to retrieve partial data rather than the entire dataset. This is achieved by leveraging the database to store and implementing a pagination mechanism.

Originally, the plan involved integrating memory reduction measures in both the Consul and Controller processes. However, after thorough exploration, we have not identified an optimal solution considering the deployment model and data synchronization across controllers.

Consequently, this aspect will be excluded from the current release and is planned to be deferred to the subsequent version. This minimizes the system's scope and potential impacts.

## Section 1: Overview

The primary objective is to enhance the performance of the Vulnerability Page, issues we want to address are:
- slow page load time 
- out-of-memory errors in browsers

## Section 2: Design

Our system utilizes SQLite as its embedded database, with each controller maintaining an database. No supplementary processes are introduced, and SQLite access is facilitated through an imported package. 

SQLite enhances our data querying capabilities, offers a file-based structure for simplified management, and contributes to system efficiency with its lightweight design.

This section introduces various design considerations, including:
- [data handling process](#data-handling-process)
- [data hook point](#data-hook-point)
- [database design](#database-design)
- [data filtering](#data-filtering)
- [multi-controller](#multi-controller)
- [session temp file](#session-temp-file)
- [session temp file cleanup](#session-temp-file-cleanup)

### data handling process

The entire data handling process is divided into three distinct phases based on timing: 
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ pre-process
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ process
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ post-process

<b>Pre-process</b> This phase initiates when raw data becomes available, typically following the completion of a scan report. During this stage, the data is populated into the database.

<b>Process</b> This phase is triggered when the UI requests page data. The primary objective here is to compile data specific to the query, considering variations due to user roles, filter criteria, and time. Upon completion, a temporary table is generated to store the results, and a query_token is returned to the caller. This token allows the UI to fetch data and navigate through the results.

<b>Post-process</b> This phase is activated when the UI fetches the data. To minimize tasks during the process phase, certain operations are intentionally deferred to this stage. These deferred tasks are executed when the user expresses the need to view the data.

### data hook point

The data hook point is initiated upon completion of the scan task (`func scanDone()` and `func RegistryImageStateUpdate()`). 

This hook point serves as the focal point for the Controller to establish its cache. Currently, we are extending its functionality to encompass the construction of the database.

Raw data obtained from the scan is processed through functions like `FillVulTraits()` function to generate data needed for database population. 

<b>Currently, we extract only the necessary data for the database without altering or deleting any information in the Controller's cache data structures. The initial strategy involves optimizing memory usage by eliminating certain fields in cache mappings. But it will not be in this change.</b>

Here is a simplified code snippet:
```
// This is called on every controller by key update
func scanDone(id string, objType share.ScanObjectType, report *share.CLUSScanReport) {
    info, ok := scanMap[id]
    info.vulTraits = scanUtils.ExtractVulnerability(report.Vuls)
    alives = vpf.FilterVulTraits(info.vulTraits, info.idns)
    highs, meds = scanUtils.GatherVulTrait(info.vulTraits)

    brief := fillScanBrief(info, len(highs), len(meds))
    info.brief = brief
    info.filteredTime = time.Now()

    vuls := scanUtils.FillVulTraits(sdb.CVEDB, baseOS, c.vulTraits, "", true)    üëà
    for _, vul := range vuls {
        database3.PopulateVulAsset3(database3.TypeWorkload, c.workload.ID, vul, baseOS)  üëà
    }
    database3.PopulateAssetVul(dbAssetVul)                                       üëà
}
```

### database design

The database table is crafted to optimize for the Vulnerability Page. This page necessitates the incorporation of two distinct aspects of data: vulnerability-based and asset-based information.

schema:
```
CREATE TABLE vulassets (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,name TEXT,severity TEXT,description TEXT,
                    packages TEXT,link TEXT,score NUMERIC,vectors TEXT,score_v3 NUMERIC,vectors_v3 TEXT,
                    published_timestamp INTEGER, last_modified_timestamp INTEGER,
                    workloads TEXT,nodes TEXT,images TEXT,platforms TEXT,cve_sources 
                    TEXT,f_withFix INTEGER,f_profile INTEGER,debuglog TEXT)

CREATE TABLE assetvuls (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,type TEXT,assetid TEXT UNIQUE,name TEXT,
                    w_domain TEXT,w_applications TEXT,policy_mode TEXT,w_service_group TEXT,
                    cve_high INTEGER,cve_medium INTEGER,cve_low INTEGER,cve_count INTEGER,cve_lists TEXT,
                    scanned_at TEXT,n_os TEXT,n_kernel TEXT,n_cpus INTEGER,n_memory INTEGER,
                    n_containers INTEGER,p_version TEXT,p_base_os TEXT)

CREATE TABLE querystats (id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,token TEXT,create_timestamp INTEGER,
                    login_type TEXT,login_id TEXT,login_name TEXT,data1 TEXT,data2 TEXT,data3 TEXT)

```

### data filtering 

Within the backend, it replicate all query logic initially embedded in the front-end. This process entails translating queries received from the UI into the relevant SQL queries. 

In the current version, I prioritizes adopting direct SQL execution if the query can be seamlessly accomplished in SQL. However, if this is not feasible due to complexity or table design constraints, the system implements the necessary filtering logic in the Golang code.

The schema design encompasses considerations such as normalization levels, data modification patterns, and maintainability. In this version, I have opted for a relatively straightforward model, acknowledging the complexity of certain data and logic aspects, such as namespace checking in user roles, which is challenging to map directly. I find it more preferable to retain such logic within the Golang code and maintain it in a centralized location.

Given the context, I didn't use ORM tool to facilitate the interaction between a database and the application code by abstracting the database interactions. 

<p align="left">
<img src="./materials/ui-query.png" width="85%">
</p>

I use a package `goqu` to construct SQL statement. Refer to [goqu](https://github.com/doug-martin/goqu) for details. 

The following code snippets demonstrate the construction of SQL statements by incorporating user-provided filters.

<b>statement we need</b>
```
SELECT "assetid", "name", "w_domain", "w_applications", "policy_mode", "w_service_group", "cve_high", 
    "cve_medium", "cve_low", "cve_lists", "scanned_at" FROM "assetvuls"
    WHERE (("type" = 'workload') AND ("assetid" IN ('7a70...','286b9...'))
    AND (("w_domain" LIKE '%kube-system%') OR ("w_domain" LIKE '%default%')))
```

code snippets to generate the statement:
```
func getWorkloadAssetView(allowed map[string]utils.Set, vulMap map[string]*DbVulAsset, queryFilter *VulQueryFilter) {
	records := make([]*api.RESTWorkloadAssetView, 0)

	columns := []interface{}{"assetid", "name", "w_domain", "w_applications", "policy_mode", "w_service_group",
							"cve_high", "cve_medium", "cve_low", "cve_lists", "scanned_at"}

	dialect := goqu.Dialect("sqlite3")

	allowedWorkloads := allowed["workloads"].ToStringSlice()
	statement, args, _ := dialect.From("assetvuls").Select(columns...)
                                 .Where(buildWhereClauseForWorkload(allowedWorkloads, queryFilter.Filters))
                                .Prepared(true).ToSQL()

	rows, err := dbHandle.Query(statement, args...)


func buildWhereClauseForWorkload(allowedID []string, queryFilter *api.VulQueryFilterViewModel) exp.ExpressionList {
    part1_assetType := goqu.Ex{
        "type": "workload",
    }

    if queryFilter.MatchType4Ns == "equals" {
        part3_domain_equals = goqu.Ex{
            "w_domain": queryFilter.SelectedDomains,
        }
    } else if queryFilter.MatchType4Ns == "contains" {

        for _, d := range queryFilter.SelectedDomains {
            domain_contains = append(domain_contains, goqu.C("w_domain").Like(fmt.Sprintf("%%%s%%", d)))
        }
    }
    ...
    return goqu.And(part1_assetType, part2_allowed,
		part3_domain_equals, goqu.Or(domain_contains...),
		part_service_equal, goqu.Or(part_service_contains...),
		part_container_equal, goqu.Or(part_container_contains...))

```

### multi-controller

Given that each controller operates independently and the database (it's embedded to the Controller process) is not shared, an essential mechanism is required to enable other controllers to construct the same session temporary table. 

To achieve this, a request containing user roles, advanced filters, and query_token is written to Consul. This action serves as a signal to inform other controllers. Subsequently, these controllers can utilize the provided query_token to serve requests at a later stage.

<b>Consul</b>
```
object/config/querysession/mm_fc0570a6e925
object/config/querysession/mm_fd3d6d6a87e9
```

<b>sample data</b>
```
{
    "QueryToken": "fe40e88abbf5",
    "UserAccess": {
        "Op": "write",
        "Roles": {
            "": "admin"
        },
        "WRoles": {},
        "ApiCategoryID": 5,
        "RequiredPermissions": 524360,
        "BoostPermissions": 0
    },
    "Filters": {
        "packageType": "all",
        "severityType": "all",
        "scoreType": "v3",
        ...
    }
}
```

### session temp file 

To optimize performance during the process phase, the system employs a strategic approach. The session temporary table is initially written to a memory-based database to promptly fulfill first few initial requests. 

Concurrently, in the background, a file-based database is created. Once the file-based table has been successfully created, the memory-based table is deleted. This dual-step process effectively balances the imperative for rapid response times.

The temporary files are stored in the /tmp folder, and the system will automatically clean up these files upon the deletion of the session.

```
/tmp # ls -l
total 85424
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         12288 Dec 19 04:39 cvedb.db
drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root          4096 Dec 18 20:28 neuvector
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      10735616 Dec 19 05:49 vulasset.db
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            15 Dec 19 05:45 ready
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      10952704 Dec 19 05:07 tmp_session_11ca60087b27   üëà
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      10960896 Dec 19 05:40 tmp_session_25b56e99571a
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      10952704 Dec 19 05:03 tmp_session_2bcf783a6430
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      10952704 Dec 19 05:06 tmp_session_98dc06906d30
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      10960896 Dec 19 05:40 tmp_session_a4623fbb0844
```

### session temp file cleanup

Given the dynamic nature of query results, the system employs session temporary tables for storage. Typically, a new session is unnecessary when users perform subsequent queries, such as changing filter criteria. 

To streamline resource usage, a maximum of 10 queries per user and 2 for apikey is kept. This limitation ensures that older sessions, which are no longer needed, are systematically cleaned up. 

In the event of reaching the query limit, the earliest query will be automatically removed, and the associated token unavailable.
When an expired token is utilized, the backend will respond with a specific error code.
```
const RESTErrInvalidQueryToken int = 53

Invalid or expired query token
```


## Section 3: Security

### SQL Injection prevention

The code uses parameterized queries, also known as prepared statements, as a best practice for writing SQL queries. 

This approach treats user input and other variables as parameters rather than integral parts of the SQL statement. By doing so, the system mitigates the risk of SQL injection attacks and ensures a more secure interaction with the database.

Here is some code snippet:

```
func GetAssetVulByAssetID(assetID string) (*DbAssetVul, error) {
	dialect := goqu.Dialect("sqlite3")
	statement, args, _ := dialect.From(Table_assetvuls)
                                 .Select("id")
                                 .Where(goqu.C("assetid").Eq(assetID))
                                 .Prepared(true)    üëà
                                 .ToSQL()

	rows, err := dbHandle.Query(statement, args...) üëà
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	defer rows.Close()

```

### File location

The database file is regenerated each time the Controller process starts under the `/tmp` folder. This recreation occurs without any modifications to the Kubernetes manifest. 

```
/ # cd /tmp/
/tmp # ls -l
total 61764
drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root          4096 Dec 10 00:55 neuvector
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      63221760 Dec 18 00:09 vulasset.db    üëà
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root            15 Dec 17 21:14 ready
/tmp #
```

## Section 4: API Interface & Testing bed 

Please see [API.md](./API.md)

## Section 5: Database file size

### Database File Size
In an environment with 10,000 workloads and encompassing 5,000 distinct CVEs, the database file size is approximately 84MB.  

In a scenario with 20,000 workloads and 13,000 CVEs, the database file size increases to around 161MB.  

Each individual asset is associated with 18 CVEs.

### Session Temporary File Size
For each new query, a temporary database file is generated. Each user is allowed a maximum of 10 concurrent queries, while an API Key can perform up to 2 queries. The size of the temporary file is depend on the applied filter.

## Section 6: Performance Testing
To activate this functionality, follow these steps to add an environment variable in the Controller deployment manifest:
```
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: TELEMETRY_NEUVECTOR_EP
          value: http://10.1.45.41/dbperftest
```

To generate dummy data, initiate a POST call to the `/v1/vulasset` endpoint with the following URL parameters:

```
    createdummyasset = 1        // Set to 1 to create dummy data
    howmany_cve = 5000          // Number of CVEs to generate
    howmany_asset = 10000       // Number of assets to generate
    howmany_cve_per_asset = 18  // Number of CVEs per asset
```

TODO: show an actual curl example..

Using these parameters, the system will generate 5000 CVEs with names starting with "CVE-2030," create 10000 workload assets, and allocate 18 CVEs to each asset randomly selected from the pool of 5000 CVEs.

Please note that the creation of this dataset is a long process, it took over xx minutes to create 10000 assets.

After generating the dataset, when querying using the GET `/v1/vulasset` endpoint, ensure to include a special URL parameter `perftest=1` in your request to the Controller. This instructs the Controller to treat the data as real Kubernetes workload. Since these data are not actual Kubernetes workloads, the Controller requires this flag to recognize and process them correctly. Include the special flag in your query for the proper handling of the generated data.
